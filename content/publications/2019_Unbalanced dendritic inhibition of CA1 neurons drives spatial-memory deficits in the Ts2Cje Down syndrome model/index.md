abstract: "Overinhibition is assumed one of the main causes of cognitive deficits (e.g. memory impairment) in mouse models of Down syndrome (DS). Yet the mechanisms that drive such exaggerated synaptic inhibition and their behavioral effects remain unclear. Here we report the existence of bidirectional alterations to the synaptic inhibition on CA1 pyramidal cells in the Ts2Cje mouse model of DS which are associated to impaired spatial memory. Furthermore, we identify triplication of the kainate receptor (KAR) encoding gene Grik1 as the cause of these phenotypes. Normalization of Grik1 dosage in Ts2Cje mice specifically restored spatial memory and reversed the bidirectional alterations to CA1 inhibition, but not the changes in synaptic plasticity or the other behavioral modifications observed. We propose that modified information gating caused by disturbed inhibitory tone rather than generalized overinhibition underlies some of the characteristic cognitive deficits in DS."
