An eloquent example of adult circuit remodelling is the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) sprouting found in diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy. The molecular determinants underlying this retrograde re-wiring remain unclear. This may involve signaling system(s) controlling axon specification/growth during neurodevelopment reactivated during epileptogenesis. Since adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) control axon formation/outgrowth and synapse stabilization during development, we now examined the contribution of A2AR to MF sprouting. A2AR blockade significantly attenuated status epilepticus(SE)-induced MF sprouting in a rat pilocarpine model. This involves A2AR located in dentate granule cells since their knockdown selectively in dentate granule cells reduced MF sprouting, most likely through the ability of A2AR to induce the formation/outgrowth of abnormal secondary axons found in rat hippocampal neurons. These A2AR should be activated by extracellular ATP-derived adenosine since a similar prevention/attenuation of SE-induced hippocampal MF sprouting was observed in CD73 knockout mice. These findings demonstrate that A2AR contribute to epilepsy-related MF sprouting, most likely through the reactivation of the ability of A2AR to control axon formation/outgrowth observed during neurodevelopment. These results frame the CD73-A2AR axis as a regulator of circuit remodeling in the mature brain.","tags":null,"title":"Adenosine A2A receptors control synaptic remodeling in the adult brain","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Sebastian Krüttner","Antonio Falasconi","**Sergio Valbuena**","Ivan Galimberti","Tewis Bouwmeester","Silvia Arber","Pico Caroni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645747200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645747200,"objectID":"faa382d131532495a1459f5224162fdf","permalink":"https://svalbuenaa.github.io/publications/2022_absence-of-familiarity-triggers-hallmarks-of-autism-in-mouse-model-through-aberrant-tail-of-striatum-and-prelimbic-cortex-signaling.html","publishdate":"2022-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2022_absence-of-familiarity-triggers-hallmarks-of-autism-in-mouse-model-through-aberrant-tail-of-striatum-and-prelimbic-cortex-signaling.html","section":"publications","summary":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves genetic and environmental components. The underlying circuit mechanisms are unclear, but behaviorally, aversion toward unfamiliarity, a hallmark of autism, might be involved. Here, we show that in Shank3ΔC/ΔC ASD model mice, exposure to novel environments lacking familiar features produces long-lasting failure to engage and repetitive behaviors upon re-exposure. Inclusion of familiar features at first context exposure prevented enhanced dopamine transients in tail of striatum (TS) and restored context-specific control of engagement to wild-type levels in Shank3ΔC/ΔC mice. Engagement upon context re-exposure depended on the activity in prelimbic cortex (PreL)-to-TS projection neurons in wild-type mice and was restored in Shank3ΔC/ΔC mice by the chemogenetic activation of PreL→TS projection neurons. Environmental enrichment prevented ASD-like phenotypes by obviating the dependence on PreL→TS activity. Therefore, novel context experience has a key role in triggering ASD-like phenotypes in genetically predisposed mice, and behavioral therapies involving familiarity and enrichment might prevent the emergence of ASD phenotypes.","tags":null,"title":"Absence of familiarity triggers hallmarks of autism in mouse model through aberrant tail-of-striatum and prelimbic cortex signaling","type":"publications"},{"authors":["**Sergio Valbuena**","Juan Lerma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"35d68219e6caddcaafe31872f1ce5da4","permalink":"https://svalbuenaa.github.io/publications/2021_losing-balance-kainate-receptors-and-psychiatric-disorders-comorbidities.html","publishdate":"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2021_losing-balance-kainate-receptors-and-psychiatric-disorders-comorbidities.html","section":"publications","summary":"Cognition and behavior are tightly linked to synaptic function. A growing body of evidence suggests that aberrant neurotransmission, caused by changes in synaptic protein expression levels, may be a major cause underlying different brain disorders. These changes in expression result in abnormal synaptic organization or function, leading to impaired neurotransmission and unbalanced circuit operations. Here, we review the data supporting the involvement of mutations in genes coding for kainate receptor (KAR) subunits in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders and Down syndrome (DS). We show that most of these mutations do not affect the biophysical properties or the receptors, but rather alter subunit expression levels. On the basis of reports studying KAR genes mutations in mouse models of autism spectrum disorders and DS, we illustrate how deviations from the physiological regulatory role that these receptors play in neurotransmitter release and plasticity give rise to synaptic alterations that lead to behavioral and cognitive deficits underlying these disorders.","tags":null,"title":"Losing balance: Kainate receptors and psychiatric disorders comorbidities","type":"publications"},{"authors":["**Sergio Valbuena**","Juan Lerma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"8d0dc12c26b3aba7642d77f3068c5a82","permalink":"https://svalbuenaa.github.io/publications/2021-kainate-receptors-homeostatic-gatekeepers-of-synaptic-plasticity.html","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2021-kainate-receptors-homeostatic-gatekeepers-of-synaptic-plasticity.html","section":"publications","summary":"Extensive research over the past decades has characterized multiple forms of synaptic plasticity, identifying them as key processes that allow the brain to operate in a dynamic manner.

While ionotropic receptors form ion channels and mediate rapid membrane depolarization, so-called metabotropic receptors exert their action though slower, less direct intracellular signaling pathways.

How these alternative pathways affect neuronal circuit activity is not well understood, and their influence could be more significant than previously anticipated.

The approach is based on photoswitchable ligands containing a short-lived, highly reactive anchoring group that is targeted at the protein of interest by ligand affinity. These targeted covalent photoswitches (TCPs) constitute a new class of light-regulated drugs and act as prosthetic molecules that photocontrol the activity of GluK1-expressing neurons, and restore photoresponses in degenerated retina.

Nevertheless, it is not clear how these ion channels activate G-proteins and which of the KAR subunits is involved. Here we performed a proteomic analysis to define proteins that interact with the C-terminal domain of GluK1 and we identified a variety of proteins with many different functions, including a Go α subunit.

We found that KARs modulate neuronal maturation and neurite outgrowth in a bidirectional manner. Accordingly, low concentrations of KA delayed maturation and enhanced neurite outgrowth, whereas maturation was promoted by higher concentrations of KA that attenuated neuritic elongation. The effects of weak KAR activation were prevented by blocking their noncanonical signaling and involved a differential regulation of CRMP2. Whereas the delay in maturation involves PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CRMP2 at T555 leading to a downregulation of membrane Cav2.2, the promotion of neurite outgrowth is achieved by dephosphorylation at T514 at the growth cones, the latter reflecting PKC-driven enhancement of GSK3β phosphorylation at S9.

One of the main determinants of active drug secretion into milk is the ATP-binding cassette transporter G2/breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2/BCRP). It is located in several organs associated with drug absorption, metabolism, and excretion, and its expression is highly induced during lactation in the mammary gland of ruminants, mice, and humans. As a consequence, potential contamination of milk could expose suckling infants to xenotoxins. In cows, a SNP for this protein affecting quality and quantity of milk production has been described previously (Y581S). In this study, our main purpose was to determine whether this polymorphism has an effect on transcellular transport of veterinary drugs because this could alter substrate pharmacokinetics and milk residues. We stably expressed the wild-type bovine ABCG2 and the Y581S variant in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCKII) and MEF3.8 cell lines generating cell models in which the functionality of the bovine transporter could be addressed. Functional studies confirmed the greater functional activity in mitoxantrone accumulation assays for the Y581S variant with a greater relative VMAX value (P = 0.040) and showed for the first time that the Y581S variant presents greater transcellular transport of the model ABCG2 substrate nitrofurantoin (P = 0.024) and of 3 veterinary antibiotics, the fluoroquinolone agents enrofloxacin (P = 0.035), danofloxacin (P = 0.001), and difloxacin (P = 0.008), identified as new substrates of the bovine ABCG2. In addition, the inhibitory effect of the macrocyclic lactone ivermectin on the activity of wild-type bovine ABCG2 and the Y581S variant was also confirmed, showing a greater inhibitory potency on the wild-type protein at all the concentrations tested (5 μM, P = 0.017; 10 μM, P = 0.001; 25 μM, P = 0.008; and 50 μM, P = 0.003). Differential transport activity depending on the genotype together with the differential inhibition pattern might have clinical consequences, including changes in substrate pharmacokinetics (and subsequently pharmacodynamics) and more specifically, changes in secretion of ABCG2 substrates into milk, potentially implying important consequences to veterinary therapeutics.","tags":null,"title":"Analysis of the effect of the bovine adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter G2 single nucleotide polymorphism Y581S on transcellular transport of veterinary drugs using new cell culture models","type":"publications"}]
